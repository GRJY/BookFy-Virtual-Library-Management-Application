## Code Sample
Below is an example of the reading statistics visualization implemented in the home page using Chart.js, demonstrating dynamic data integration with PHP:

```javascript
const ctx = document.getElementById('libraryStatistics');
new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: <?php echo json_encode($labels); ?>,
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Okuma istatistiklerin',
            data: <?php echo json_encode($data); ?>,
            backgroundColor: '#2f8ffd'
        }]
    }
});
```

This snippet highlights the use of Chart.js for visualizing user reading habits, with data dynamically fetched from the backend.
